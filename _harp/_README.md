# I wanna join Intercom
Short Landing Page showing my strong interest in joining the Intercom team as a Product Design Intern for 4 months.

## :book: The Story

Since I really love what [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is doing and I haven't found any job posting that would tell that they are looking of interns, I have decided to create one.

I have created my first website at the age of 11, done my first freelance job at the age of 13. Before graduating high school, [my website](http://hostmeinca.com/) hit #1 on [YC Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and I got a chance to work with [Darius Monsef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_A._Monsef_IV), founder of [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/). After that I have started studying bachelor program in Software Engineering because I wanted to have a good overview in SE as well. Last summer I have been a Design Intern at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and this summer I would love to try the work at Intercom!
