        ul
          li I’m not a superhero or a unicorn. But I learn fast and I want to become a better Product Designer.
          li I love your company culture and way you communicate with outside world (books, podcast…).
          li In the future I would like to make a transition to Product Management. Where can I learn how to be a good PM than in the place where product management evolved?
          li We share the same values.

        h2 I can benefit your team by
        ul
          li Working on ideas that have high priority and need more resources.
          li Bringing a fresh pair of eyes. See the things from different point of view.
          li Bringing more code talent into a team.
          li And finally - introducing you to Slovak culture. For instance, do you know how to pronounce “čučoriedky”?
